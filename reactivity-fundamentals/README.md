# Why Refs?​

You might be wondering why we need refs with the .value instead of plain variables. To explain that, we will need to briefly discuss how Vue's reactivity system works.

When you use a ref in a template, and change the ref's value later, Vue automatically detects the change and updates the DOM accordingly. This is made possible with a dependency-tracking based reactivity system. When a component is rendered for the first time, Vue tracks every ref that was used during the render. Later on, when a ref is mutated, it will trigger a re-render for components that are tracking it.

In standard JavaScript, there is no way to detect the access or mutation of plain variables. However, we can intercept the get and set operations of an object's properties using getter and setter methods.
